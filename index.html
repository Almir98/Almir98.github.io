                            By increasing the temperature in the greenhouse, Arduino motors automatically open the
                            windows and the fan starts to work in order

                            The application uses The Movie Database (TMDB) - The Movie Database API.
                            Application where you can search movies by genres, various TV series and where you can see
                            the latest and most popular movies.
                            It will also be possible to view TV series, actors, details about actors and movies and the
                            series in which they have acted.
                            I like to watch movies and the idea was to make a website to get the latest movies as easy
                            as possible.
